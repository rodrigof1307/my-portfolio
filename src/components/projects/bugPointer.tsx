                <b>Bug Pointer</b> is a <b>bug bounty platform</b> that effectively <b>addresses the challenge of Sybil attacks</b> using Worldcoin's ZK proof of personhood system. 
                <br/><br/> 
                The platform allows for the <b>creation of contests with bounties</b> for developers and judges. The <b>judges are randomly selected</b> using Verifiable Random Function (VRF) Chainlink Technology to ensure fairness.
                <br/><br/> 
                During the contest, <b>developers can analyze smart contracts and submit vulnerabilities</b> within a specified time period. Once the contest ends, <b>judges evaluate the vulnerabilities</b>, and the results are published on a leaderboard. 
                <br/><br/> 
                The project's MVP was developed during the <b>ETHGlobal Lisbon Hackathon</b> in May 2023 and was awarded <b>Chainlink's Best Hack prize</b> and <b>Worldcoin's Honorable Mention prize</b>.
                <br/><br/> 
                I was responsible for developing the website's frontend using <b>Next.js</b>, <b>TypeScript</b>, and <b>Tailwind CSS</b> and I was also responsible for integrating our <b>Solidity</b> Smart Contracts with the Frontend using <b>wagmi</b> and <b>viem</b>. The project also used Foundry to develop and test the Smart Contracts as well as SQLite and Prisma to store the contests info.
